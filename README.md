This is my stab at a WebGL game engine, which I'm using as a tool to learn WebGL. You probably don't even want to look at the code at this point, because it's terrible and barely does anything. I'm still getting my WebGL legs under me, so it'll probably be a while before there's anything reasonably useful in this repo.
